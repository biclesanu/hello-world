Hello people!

This is my first repo. I made a site in order to learn how to use github and how to manage a repository. 
The site is a presentation of my beautiful plants.
I learned how to put up a site hosted by github. I also learned how to use branches and their importance.

This repository is just so I can understand the basics of github.
